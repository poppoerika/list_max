# Project-6a

Write a **recursive** function named list_max that takes as its parameter a list of numbers and returns the maximum value in the list.  You can assume the list contains at least one element.  If multiple elements of the list are tied for the maximum, you would still return that value.

Does not call the built-in max() function.

This recursive function must **not**:
* use any loops
* use any variables declared outside of the function
* use any mutable default arguments
